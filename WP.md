# HyperStar White Paper

## Introduction

HyperStar, Hyper*, H* - initiative to quickly run experiments in public goods funding and support founders.

*If the idea doesn't sound too crazy maybe it shouldn't be tested at all?*

Technically speaking the goal is to summon web3 hyperstrucutre that will fuel public goods

## Framework

### Eligibility
1. Public good
2. Serious projects

### Current approach

1. Spread the word to find serious volunteers
2. Identify rounds (check Ideas section for inspiration)
3. Create multisigs on all chains
4. Create github repository with all the data and links
5. Crowdfund via HyperStar Crowdfunding Round:
	1. [Base](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/8453/8)
	2. [Optimism](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/10/16)
	3. [Arbitrum](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/37)
	4. [Polygon](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/137/9)
	5. [Scroll](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/534352/5)
6. Create on Telegram:
	1. Channel to share information
	2. Group to get all the founders who are interested in one place
7. While round stewards are volunteers and make decisions, as the community is small in case of if it's unclear engage the community on telegram
8. Select color for the round and use existing assets like Logo and Banner, just recolor it (TBD Link to assets)

### Running experiments

1. Multichain - run QF rounds on all chains
2. Sponsors are welcomed as grantees on the round
3. QF Crowdsourcing round for H*

## H-Structures

### Summoned H-Structures

1. [HyperDeSci](https://github.com/LunCoSim/hyperdesci)
